                <li>Add the stock to a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Once the stock is boiling, reduce the heat to low or remove the pan from the heat and keep nearby.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a wide, tall pot over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the shiitake mushrooms and butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have cooked down.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, stir, and cook for 1 minute, until the butter has melted and the garlic is aromatic.</li>
                <li>Add the rice and stir until fully coated in the mushroom mixture. Let the rice toast for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the white wine and cook until the wine has evaporated, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot stock and stir to combine. Cook, stirring frequently, until the stock is fully absorbed.</li>
                <li>Continue to add the stock, Â½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring continuously, until the broth is fully absorbed, for 15-20 minutes. Depending on how fast the rice cooks, there may be leftover stock.</li>
                <li>Once the rice is al dente, remove from the heat. Add the Parmesan and stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Top with parsley, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
